# Super Mario Replica - University Project

A classic 2D platformer game inspired by Super Mario, developed as a university project at **Óbuda University, Alba Regia Technical Faculty**.

## 📝 About the Project
This game is a tribute to the original Super Mario, built from the ground up using **C#**. The project was a collaborative effort between me and my friend, **Zámbó Ádám**, created as part of our university coursework.

The goal of the game is simple but challenging: navigate through the obstacles, dodge the incoming turtles, and reach the top of the level to win!

## 🎮 Features
* **Classic Gameplay:** Experience the nostalgic platformer feel.
* **Challenging Enemies:** Watch out for the turtles! Collision will end your run.
* **Vertical Progression:** Reach the top of the map to succeed.
* **Responsive Controls:** Intuitive **WASD** movement.
* **Custom Levels:** Fully customizable world via external configuration.

## 🛠 Custom Level Design (Level Loader)
You can design your own levels! Before launching the game, you can modify the level layout in a **`.txt` file**. Each character represents a specific element (e.g., walls, enemies, or the goal). This allows for endless replayability and creative map design.

## ⌨️ Controls
* **W** - Jump
* **A** - Move Left
* **D** - Move Right
* **S** - Jump off

Developed with passion by:
